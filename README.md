<h1> Square Geometrising Project</h1>
<p>
Early project I took mid university. Truthfully the code isn't great but after my current Fluid simulation project I plan on rewriting all of this so it isn't nearly as bad. </p>

Some previews of the code working:</p>

<h2>Change to make</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p>Make this in C# or some other low level language, python is too slow.</p></li>
  <li><p>Change how im finding shape pixels, rotate it around central axis and extrapolate points rather than rotate corners then filter out irrelevant points</p></li>
</ul>
